# 🌍 Global Food & Agriculture Statistics Dashboard

This project presents an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that visualizes key global indicators related to **food production, fertilizers, land efficiency, and crop performance**.  
The dashboard consists of **three main pages**, each focusing on a specific analytical area.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is based on **FAO Global Food & Agriculture Statistics**.  
Due to its large size, it is not hosted directly on GitHub. You can download it from Kaggle:


### 📌 [Global Food and Agriculture Statistics (FAO) - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unitednations/global-food-agriculture-statistics)


## 📄 1 — Overview Dashboard 
Provides a **high-level summary of global agriculture**, including:

### Key Metrics
- Production yield
- Crop yield per hectare
- Total nutrient (NPK) consumption
- Fertilizer production
- Nutrient Use Efficiency (NUE)

### Visuals
- Fertilizer usage over time
- Fertilizer trends
- Net yield per hectare by country
- NUE by category
- Top fertilizer-consuming countries
- Yield per hectare trend (1960–2000)

> This page gives an **overall snapshot** of global agricultural performance and fertilizer efficiency.

## 🌱 2 — Fertilizers & Land Dashboard 

Focuses on **agricultural land insights** and **fertilizer-related analytics**.

### Key Metrics
- Total land area
- Agricultural land area & percentage
- Land efficiency (Ton/Ha)

### Visuals
- Top countries by land efficiency
- Top 5 crop categories by production share
- Land efficiency trend (1960–2000)
- Forest area trend over time

> This page highlights the **relationship between land use, crop production, and sustainability**.

## 🌾 3 — Crops & Production Dashboard 

Analyzes **crop production, food availability, and long-term trends**.

### Key Metrics
- Total crop production
- Forest area
- Total food production
- Total fertilizer use

### Visuals
- Global food production map
- Crop production by category
- Average crop production trend (1960–present)
- Yield per hectare trend
- Top 5 food-producing countries

### Key Insights
- Crop yields continue to rise steadily
- Cereals dominate global production
- Food output is concentrated in a few countries
- Fertilizer use is increasing faster than yields
- Forest area grows slowly compared to agriculture
