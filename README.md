##🌾 Global Agriculture, Land & Forest Dashboard
Power BI Project – FAO Dataset Analysis

This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of global agricultural production, land distribution, fertilizer use, and forest resources using data from the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization).
The goal is to offer clear, data-driven insights into productivity, land efficiency, sustainability, and the balance between agriculture and forest ecosystems.

***📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is too large to be hosted directly on GitHub.
Instead, the original source from Kaggle is referenced below:

###📌 Global Food and Agriculture Statistics (FAO)

***🧮 DAX Measures

The project includes a full set of clean, optimized DAX calculations such as:

Total Production

Total Food Availability

Total Fertilizer Use

Fertilizer Intensity

Yield per Hectare

Import Dependency %

Land Efficiency

***🌟 Key Insights

Crop yields are improving steadily across years.

Cereals dominate global production.

Food production is highly concentrated in top countries.

Food availability remains much lower than total output.

Fertilizer use is rising faster than yields.

Forest land remains stable but increases slowly.

Agricultural land continues to expand, driven by crop demand.
